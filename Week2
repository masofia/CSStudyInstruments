Week 2 Progress Report

- Looked at the following utils: tail, pwd,	chmod, date, cp, rm, mkdir, sort, sleep, ps, ping, tar, df	
- When pulled latest version of master ran into "ImportError: No module named checker" injector error when running rreplay
  - Reverting to older version of rrapper did not fix this error, using new VM also produced same error
