Week 1 Progress Report

- Setup crash simulator environment. 
- Stuck for long time because Docker installation was not working. 
- Got manual installation working.
- Ran simulator with 'ls' and 'cp'. With both applications, when running rreplay on the test, there was no output, the simulator just hung.
- When running these again after class, was able to get output. I must have been following the instructions incorrectly before, not aligning events properly maybe or choosing lines that are part of the loading of the lib. After class, saw problems with the 'openat' system call since this was not supported.
